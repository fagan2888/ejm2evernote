Econ Job Market 2016 ads conversion to Evernote notes


Python conversion scripts for the JOE and EJM ad export XML files. 

Works with "full" XML export from JOE (https://www.aeaweb.org/joe/listings.php)

The EJM data can be exported as XLS file from EJM/AIMS and then has to be manually converted to XML in Excel using the xml_schema (how to at http://www.excel-easy.com/examples/xml.html)
